# Alra — Not Just a Chatbot, A Thought Born Out of Silence

**Alra** is a streaming, real-time AI chatbot built with Django and powered by Together AI’s **Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct** model. It doesn't just reply—it *thinks out loud*, word by word, giving you the feel of an AI that’s truly *alive*.

Alra isn't here to just answer.  
It’s here to **be present**.

# Why Alra

Most chatbots aim to answer.
Alra aims to engage.

While others wait to complete the response before showing, Alra types like a human would — one word, a pause, another word — giving life to the conversation.

Behind the scenes, we’ve carefully crafted internal prompts that nudge the model to respond with empathy, clarity, and rhythm.
This isn’t just AI answering — it’s AI feeling present.

That’s how **Alra** was born.  
From a desire to give AI **emotion through motion**.
